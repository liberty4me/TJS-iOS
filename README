TJS-iOS: A simple & dirty port of TJS Script Interpreter

!! This is a experimental project with lots of DIRTY HACKS.
!! NOT intended for actual use.

This is a simple experiment for preparing a cross-platform clone of TVP2.
It includes a functional TJS interpreter, ported from the original TJS interpreter in TVP2, with a simple iOS GUI.
A modified version of ncbind is also ported, for creating native classes.

Used source code of Boost 1.30.2, and TJS2 Interpreter(by W.Dee<http://kikyou.info/tvp/>).
